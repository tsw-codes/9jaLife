🧠 How It Works

Dynamic Proverbs:
JavaScript randomly selects and displays one proverb with its English translation each time the page loads.

Hover Animation:
Images grow slightly when hovered to create an engaging, lively interface.

Cultural Integration:
Phrases like “We dey vibe Naija style!” and “Mey we Yarn” are included to authentically reflect Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba expressions.
